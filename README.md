# Nomie 6 Open Source

Since Closing down nomie (https://nomie.app), I wanted to provide it as an open source project.

## Open Source Life Tracker / Mood Tracker / Data Journal

![Nomie 6 Github](https://shareking.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen-Shot-2022-12-31-11-20-09.31-w0qBQwGRkANjPuv5Xtl1xFHYFIg0GgJSYluiKMI5v69Ak7Lgbk5g0mR9bx9QrdiRlUVQrmXGb4T1AwIA02oApD3YfL97thUL0Kl3.png)

## Downloading and running on any HTTP server

Nomie 6 can be run on any web server without special server side code.

Latest build: [`bin/nomie6-oss.latest.zip`](https://github.com/open-nomie/nomie6-oss/raw/master/bin/nomie6-oss.latest.zip)

## Building and Running

You'll need Node >= 16 and NPM. I have not tested running this on Windows.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:happydata/nomie6-oss.git
cd nomie6-oss
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How Nomie Works

Nomie stores each record as a log - with all tracker, people and context data being stored as a string in the `log.note` field. Nomie then parses the notes to extract structured data in real time.

For example:

`Today I walked #miles(5) #mood(8)` is converted to a structure like: `{ 'miles' : 5, 'mood': 8 }`

A more complicated example would be:

`Today @em @maddy and I #walked(4) +memory`

which would be converted into something like:

```javascript
{
    people:['em','maddy'],
    trackers: { walked: 4},
    context:['memory']
}
```

## Meet the Nouns

- **Tracker** - primarily represented by a button on the "track board". Trackers are represented by their hashtag in notes - for example: #sleep(160000).
- **Board** - a board is specific group of trackers.
- **Board Tabs** - how you switch boards on the track tab
- **Log** - a record event. A lot contains a note, a note can contain unlimited numbers of tags; e.g: #mood(4) #pizza #beer(12). Logs can contain a lat and long. Tracker Objects and their values are parsed out of the logs in real time.
- **Person** - a Person that you track in Nomie. You can track individuals by using the @username format.
- **Context** - a generic categorization / group using the +context format. For example ``Went to dinner with @mom +meal`
- **Location** - a physical location that you store and use later

## Coding Rules

- **Keep it readable** - focus on writing code that new people can easily understand and follow. If the code can't do it, then do it with comments. There's no such thing as too much commenting. (yes, I should follow my own rules)
- **Keep it under 300 lines** - the goal is to keep files under 300 lines of code. Note: Sometimes that's not feasible, and I break it often
- **Keep it flexible** - think in components. If you're doing something more than once, it most likely should be a component.
- **Keep it safe** - if you're deleting something of the users, consider using `await Interact.confirm("Are you sure")` to confirm they're action
- **Keep cleaning, organizing and testing** - this project didn't start very clean, or ready for unit testing, this should be an on going objective.
- **Use what's there**
  - Tailwind CSS - is the new world
